1) From within forms open the file stndrd.old via file, open.
This will add the item "standards" to the object navigator/object libraries section. 
This will now always appear in the object navigator.



2) Next open the form that you wish the calendar to? be on.



3) Expand the "library tabs" section of the "standards" item in "object libraries" to reveal 5 items, inc. "components".
 Right click on "components" & select? "object libraries" from the menu that appears.



4) From the box that appears select the component "calendar" and drag it to the 
form you wish it to be added to within the "object navigator".? It will then ask 
whether you want to "sub-class" or "copy". Select copy, or the form with the calendar
 will not work on PC's that does not have the standards item added. Copying will add 
all required bits you need for the calendar.



5) Next open the "calendar.pll" file & this will add a "calendar" item to
 the "pl/sql libraries" section on the "object navigator". 
Select the "program? unit" section and drag it up to the "programs unit" sectino of your form. 
This will add 2 items to the "programs unit" section (date_lov - package spec & date lov -package body).





6) Next on my form i added a button to call the calender with a "when_button_pressed" trigger & added? this code.




DECLARE
 XP NUMBER;
 YP NUMBER;

BEGIN XP:=GET_ITEM_PROPERTY('F_DT',X_POS); YP:=GET_ITEM_PROPERTY('F_DT',y_POS);

date_lov.get_date(sysdate,'F_DT',xp,yp,'From Date','OK','Cancel',TRUE,FALSE,FALSE);

END;
